# Description
This is an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses npm Express.js on the server side b and saves and retrieves note data from a db.json file.

This application was to be deplyed to heroku and while the program is in the node_modules folder, my computer is a new m1 chipset and using both homebrew and heroku have proven to be very challenging.

# Usage
From the integrated terminal, node server.js is run creating a port which can be used to access the note taking app.
